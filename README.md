## Important: .DS_Store files
- an invisible file on the macOS operating system that gets automatically created anytime you look into a folder with ‘Finder
- stores custom attributes/metadata of its containing folder and the names of other files around it
- exposing this information could potentially allow hackers to act maliciously and let them see private files.

How to avoid this?
- Place .DS_Store in your .gitignore file. That way, any .DS_Store file will be ignored and not be pushed with the rest of your code.
